<b>Staking</b>
Proof-of-Stake (PoS, staking) means that wallets connected and unlocked for staking to the network generate new coins and make a passive income possible simply by holding XN. 
The staking process produces new coins without consuming significant computational power like with mining and keeps the Nodium network safer. 
Anyone who holds XN in the Nodium Wallet will receive rewards for helping the blockchain. Simply keep your wallet open and your balance will generate new coins when the blocks for that are found.

<b>Unlock to stake</b>
To begin staking, download the Nodium wallet from https://nodium.org and send XN to a receiving address you own.
