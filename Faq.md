<b>Why has my coin age and weight stopped increasing ?</b>
- This is because your coins have reached their maximum age

<b>What is the mature time of the coin and is my coin gaining weight when its maturing?</b>
- Once your coins have been deposited into your wallet, they have staked, or you send coins to another person, the coins in the input from your wallet need to mature.  To do this they need  wait an initial time period of between  8 and 48 hours (usually 8 hours), during this time the coins are receiving confirmations from the network.  After the initial time period, for each confirmation your input receives,  you will see your weight increase. Until 10 days are reached, when it will stop gaining weight.

<b>I was on twitter and saw that you were giving away free <insert currency name> if I deposited  a smaller amount of currency to test the wallet was working. Is this offer real?</b>
- No, this is a common scam. If we do give away XN, we will NEVER ask you to deposit coins first

<b>My PC just crashed and now my  wallet will not open up, what should I do?</b>
- Delete all files from your nodium folder EXCEPT wallet.dat and masternodes.conf (if you have any) and restart the nodium wallet.

<b>I just opened my wallet and my masternode is MISSING</b>
- Give it some time, wait for 10 minutes. The wallet needs some time to discover all the masternodes in the network.
